# ScreepsBots
ScreepsBots is a personal public repository of the fun little bot scripts I wrote for the game.

## Why is this public?
I enjoy building in public and I really don't care if someone discovers this repository and improves their own scripts
after viewing my files; whether my scripts are good or bad. Honestly if it makes some ones day then I'm happy.

## What is Screeps Arena?
Screeps Arena is a fast-paced, competitive multiplayer environment within the Screeps universe, where players command 
autonomous units, known as creeps, to engage in strategic battles against each other. Set in a shared arena, players
must use programming skills to develop efficient algorithms for their creeps, enabling them to gather resources, defend
against attacks, and outmaneuver rival players. The objective is to showcase tactical prowess and clever coding, as 
victories depend not just on combat skills, but also on adapting to the ever-changing strategies of opponents. The arena
fosters a vibrant community of developers, where players continuously learn and improve through both competition and 
collaboration.
